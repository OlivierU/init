\subsubsection{Objectives and hypotheses}

To further the understanding of the neuronal circuitry involved in inhibitory processes related to alcohol specific stimuli we intend to investigate functional connections between various subcortical regions known to be implicated in the act of inhibitory control, as well as search for further connections linking these areas to cortical regions that may be used as targets for non-invasive brain stimulation. We intend to use these findings to identify patient specific cortical gateway regions to stimulate during established inhibition training session in order to investigate the stimulation's potential to bolster the improvement in inhibitory control performance evoked by these trainings.

\subsubsection{Study design, procedures, and measures}

To allow for a thorough later analysis of the trainings' effects, we will initially conduct a baseline measure of both inhibitory control as well as the individuals' reactions to alcoholic stimuli. Inihbitory control is measured by a modified Go/NoGo task using alcohol related stimuli as no-go signals. These kinds of Go/NoGo task find widespread use in the assesment of inhibitory control in a context of AUD and provide a robust measure to assess an individual's ability to inhibit an automatised response to alcohol related information (\cite{amesNeuralCorrelatesGo2014,bowleyEffectsInhibitoryControl2013,roseEffectsAlcoholInhibitory2008,simmondsMetaanalysisGoNogo2008}). Unlike the Go/NoGo task used in the actual inhibition training (\cite{houbenBeerNogoLearning2012}), this task uses the alcoholic stimuli, i.e. images depicting alcoholic beverages, as NoGo signals, which stand in contrast to pictures of non-alcoholic beverages that serve as Go signals. The participants are thus instructed to press a button whenever a Go signal appears, but not when a NoGo signal does. The stimuli are presented in a randomised order and a four to one ratio of Go and NoGo signals, respectively. This ratio has been shown to ensure the formation of a pre-potent response tendency towards Go signals (\cite{amesNeuralCorrelatesGo2014}). Since the task will be performed during an fMRI scan the timings of both the trials and the inter trial duration will be jittered.

Each participant's neurophysiological reaction to alcoholic stimuli will be measured using a simple cue reactivity task consisting of alcholic stimuli. These baseline measures will be conducted during an fMRI scan, following a T1 weighted structural scan to infer anatomical information of each participant.
Based on the fMRI data collected during the cue reactivity task, BOLD signals will be analysed to assess individual neurophysiological activity in regions of interest during confrontation with AUD related stimuli. The functional data obtained during the Go/NoGo task will be used to conduct connectivity analyses between inhibitory regions and a series of candidate regions closer to the surface of the brain. These analyses are intended to identifiy potential gateway regions, which can be used as targets of non-invasive brain stimulation and would propagate the stimulation's effects to the lower laying inhibitory regions that cannot be targeted directly. Potential gateway regions include the premotor cortex, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the orbitofrontal cortex. Based on these connectivity data for each participant, an individualised stimulation locust will be decided upon to be used during stimulation enhanced inhibition training.
